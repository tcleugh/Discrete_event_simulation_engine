## Discrete Event Simulation

In this project, we are simulating a complex queueing network model, with motivation coming from a typical amusement park setup (eg MovieWorld). 

If you are interested, you can read about the in-depth description [here](https://courses.smp.uq.edu.au/MATH2504/assessment_html/project2.html)

To run default simulations, run the discrete_event_simulation_project.jl file.
(This will provide all outputs required for the project)
